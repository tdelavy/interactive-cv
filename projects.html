                    <h3>2nd Place at MEXA Hackathon: Mental Health x AI</h3>
                    <p>
                        Within 3 days, I collaborated with a team to design and develop a chatbot prototype using Python and AI. The chatbot analyzed emotions from voice recordings and scored them based on an established questionnaire for postpartum depression detection. This innovative tool aimed to provide patients with tailored support, connect them with nearby resources, and deliver actionable insights to healthcare professionals.

                    <h3>2nd Place at iTeams Medical Innovation Competition</h3>
                    <p>
                        I presented a rehabilitation solution for hemineglect patients at the iTeams Medical Innovation Competition. Leveraging insights from my Masterâ€™s research, I proposed the use of smart glasses to assist patients in regaining their ability to focus on the contralesional field of view.

                        The smart glasses would utilize visual cues to highlight objects on the neglected side, encouraging patients to shift their attention and interact with their environment more effectively. This approach aims to enhance the quality of life for patients by addressing allocentric and egocentric attention deficits, providing a practical, technology-driven solution for post-stroke rehabilitation.

                    <h3>Entrepreneurship Project - Scan To Reconnect</h3>
                    <p>
                        As part of an entrepreneurship course, I developed and presented "Scan To Reconnect", aimed at transforming the lost-and-found process using AI.

                        The application allows users to upload images of their items. By leveraging generative AI, the system generates precise descriptions of the objects based on the input provided. These descriptions are then compared against newly reported found items using advanced matching algorithms, considering both attributes and location data. Once a match is identified, the app connects the owner with the finder.

                    <h3>MindMap AI: Simplifying Research Exploration</h3>
                    <p>
                        MindMap AI is a tool designed to streamline the process of exploring and answering complex questions using your saved research papers.
                        By leveraging advanced technologies like GROBID and sentence transformers, it analyzes abstracts to identify the most relevant papers for your queries.
                        The system generates a dynamic mindmap where key papers are visually represented for easy access.
                        With interactive features, you can view abstracts, ask questions, and synthesize insights from multiple sources efficiently.
